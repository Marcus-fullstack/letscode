                    <h2>What you need to know?</h2>
                    <p>The chances of surviving an ACS event have never been better, thanks in large part to advancements in intervention not only at the hospital, but in the ambulance as well. Still the facts surrounding ACS events are sobering.
                    </p>
                    <p> According to the American Heart Association:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>About 1.05 million people will suffer a heart attack this year</li>
                        <li>Roughly 720,000 people will have a first coronary event.</li>
                        <li>Another 335,000 will have a recurrent coronary event.</li>
                        <li>It is estimated that 170,000 of these events will be “silent” heart attack with few, if any recognized symptoms.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> A heart attack, also called a myocardial infarction, can often be fatal. Studies show that almost 38% of people who experience a heart attack in any given year will die from it.
                    </p>
                    <p> While advances in cardiac interventions and therapies have improved patient outcomes, reliably getting patients to the hospital in a timely manner presents one of the greatest challenges today. This is critical to improving patient
                        outcomes. And, this is where the AngelMed Guardian system may help. Your overall lifestyle — what you eat, how often you exercise and the way you deal with stress — plays a role in your recovery.</p>
                    <p> In addition, a healthy lifestyle can help you prevent an ACS event by controlling the contributing risk factors.</p>
