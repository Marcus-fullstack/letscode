                    <h2>What you need to know?</h2>
                    <p>The chances of surviving an ACS event have never been better, thanks in large part to advancements in intervention not only at the hospital, but in the ambulance as well. Still the facts surrounding ACS events are sobering.
                    </p>
                    <p> According to the American Heart Association:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>About 1.05 million people will suffer a heart attack this year</li>
                        <li>Roughly 720,000 people will have a first coronary event.</li>
                        <li>Another 335,000 will have a recurrent coronary event.</li>
                        <li>It is estimated that 170,000 of these events will be “silent” heart attack with few, if any recognized symptoms.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> A heart attack, also called a myocardial infarction, can often be fatal. Studies show that almost 38% of people who experience a heart attack in any given year will die from it.
                    </p>
                    <p> While advances in cardiac interventions and therapies have improved patient outcomes, reliably getting patients to the hospital in a timely manner presents one of the greatest challenges today. This is critical to improving patient
                        outcomes. And, this is where the AngelMed Guardian system may help. Your overall lifestyle — what you eat, how often you exercise and the way you deal with stress — plays a role in your recovery.</p>
                    <p> In addition, a healthy lifestyle can help you prevent an ACS event by controlling the contributing risk factors.</p>

                    <h2>Catheterism & Angioplasty exam</h2>

                    <p>Catheterism is coming of Catheter word. Although Catheterism exame can be all exam made by Catheter, it is known as diagnostic exam. A Catheter is a flexible pipe, considerably secure with small soft point. In case of Heart, the tube
                        is introduced inside the pacient's body by way of artery or vein, the local with Catheter is insered from pulse, groin or alternative local in junction between arm and forewarm to Coronary Artery of Heart.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Catheter is insered by Heart's main Artery also known as Aorta, and this procediment catheterize injecting a Iodo substance. This substance retain the artery in a video, like a X-Ray movie. With frames, the physician can visualize
                        if there are obstruction of artery.</p>
                    <p>Depends on the size of this obstruction, the responsible doctor can exactly know the next steps. The grave cases are when the obstruction is above of 70%. The This video is stored in local arquive of patient. There are a great possibility
                        of dealing with Catheterism itself because the catheterism can clean the obstruction, in some cases when the Catherism can not treat this obstruction, is done an Angioplasty procediment. In remote situation is necessary make a
                        bypass cirurgy.
                    </p>

                    <p>Angio is vas and plasty is lift, angioplasty is a lift of vas, in other words, the catheter has a baloon inflating of obstructed local, compressing the local and liberating space to place of the stent. The stent is a metallic material
                        and little bit flexible responsible to maintain the local of bloody passage free. He has a substance that does not let the clog came back for months or year.
