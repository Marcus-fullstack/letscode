                    <p> Music: The music was inherent in every civilization; it was played in ritual, work and party. However some historian said that the music revived this time, after medium age.</p>
                    <p>Composers had interest in writing profane music and they wrote music for instruments. The instruments suffered little alterations because the composition musical needed to have more expression, with tons grave. However, we cannot affirm
                        that instruments in medium age are worse than renascent period because we need understand the purpose of music made in medieval period.
